                                along with Typica. It was created on the Island of Bourbon in the 18th century. The
                                variety
                                arrived into Brazil late 19th century and quickly spread around South and Middle
                                America.
                                Bourbon isn’t an extremely productive variety, but produces an excellent cup of coffee.
                                Multiple variations have been developed from Bourbon.</p>

                                Timor being a variety of Robusta, Catimors acidity is low and the flavor is a bit
